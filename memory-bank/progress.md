# Progress

## What Works
- Project scaffolding and architecture are in place
- Chrome Extension manifest and structure are set up
- React, TypeScript, Vite, and React Flow are integrated
- Popup, options, and canvas entry points are established

## What's Left to Build
- Complete implementation of the visual planning canvas
- Integrate GitHub OAuth and API features
- Implement persistent storage for user data and plans
- Add and refine AI-powered planning/documentation features
- Polish UI/UX for all extension pages
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## Current Status
The project is in the early-to-mid development phase. Core architecture and setup are complete, and the focus is shifting to feature completion, integration, and polish.

## Known Issues
- AI features and GitHub integration may require additional API handling and security review
- Chrome Extension permissions and background script messaging need thorough testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chose React Flow for the visual canvas due to its flexibility and interactivity
- Adopted Manifest V3 for Chrome Extension compatibility and security
- Decided to use chrome.storage for all persistent data to avoid backend complexity
