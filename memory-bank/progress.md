# Progress

## What Works
- Project scaffolding and architecture are in place
- Chrome Extension manifest and structure are set up
- React, TypeScript, Vite, and React Flow are integrated
- Popup, options, and canvas entry points are established
- Popup functionality for starting a new plan and loading existing plans
- Options page with fields for GitHub username, API key, and canvas settings
- Canvas page with project name input and Save/Cancel buttons

## What's Left to Build
- Complete implementation of the visual planning canvas, including tools for drawing objects
- Integrate GitHub OAuth and API features
- Implement persistent storage for user data and plans
- Add and refine AI-powered planning/documentation features
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## Current Status
The project is progressing steadily. Core architecture and setup are complete, and several key features have been implemented. The focus is now on enhancing functionality and user experience.

## Known Issues
- AI features and GitHub integration may require additional API handling and security review
- Chrome Extension permissions and background script messaging need thorough testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Chose React Flow for the visual canvas due to its flexibility and interactivity
- Adopted Manifest V3 for Chrome Extension compatibility and security
- Decided to use chrome.storage for all persistent data to avoid backend complexity
