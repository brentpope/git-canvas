# Progress

## What Works (65% Complete)
- Project scaffolding and architecture
- Chrome Extension manifest and structure
- React, TypeScript, Vite, and React Flow integration
- Popup, options, and canvas UI components
- GitHub OAuth authentication flow via Chrome identity API
- GitHub repository data retrieval and visualization
- Repository structure and issues displayed as nodes on canvas
- Project saving/loading with chrome.storage
- User-guided OAuth setup process in options page
- Error handling for GitHub API calls
- GitHub Client ID configuration via options page

## What's Left to Build (35% Remaining)
- Pull request visualization on canvas
- Commit history visualization
- Interactive canvas editing tools
- Additional node types for different GitHub entities
- Improved layout algorithms for complex repositories
- AI-powered planning/documentation features
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission
- Better security for OAuth token exchange (server-side component)

## Current Status
The project is approximately 65% complete. Core functionality including GitHub connectivity and repository visualization is working well. Users can now authenticate with GitHub, select repositories, and visualize their structure and issues on the canvas. The focus is now on enhancing the visualization and adding more interactive features.

## Known Issues
- OAuth implementation needs server-side component for proper token exchange security
- Large repositories may cause performance issues in visualization
- Rate limiting from GitHub API needs better handling
- Layout algorithm for complex repositories needs improvement

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Moved from hardcoded GitHub Client ID to user-configured value in options page for better distribution
- Added step-by-step guided setup for GitHub OAuth configuration
- Enhanced error handling for GitHub connectivity issues
- Implemented repository visualization with hierarchical structure
- Added GitHub connectivity status indicators to the popup
