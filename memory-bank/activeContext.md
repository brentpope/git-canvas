# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial documentation and memory bank setup. Reviewing and documenting the architecture, tech stack, and product context for Git Canvas Chrome Extension.

## Recent Changes
- Populated all memory bank files with accurate project documentation
- Reviewed project structure, manifest, and dependencies
- Summarized system architecture and design patterns
- Added functionality to the popup for starting a new plan and loading existing plans
- Enhanced the options page with fields for GitHub username, API key, and canvas settings
- Updated the canvas page to include a project name input field and Save/Cancel buttons

## Next Steps
- Implement GitHub repository selection and tools for drawing objects on the canvas
- Refine the Save functionality to persist project data
- Test and debug the extension for seamless user experience
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Maintain a clear separation between UI components and background logic
- Use chrome.storage for all persistent data
- Ensure compliance with Chrome Extension Manifest V3

## Patterns & Preferences
- React component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular, maintainable file structure

## Insights & Learnings
